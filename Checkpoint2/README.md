## Part B - Inspecting Local Repo with `git status` and `git log`

git status- This command is useful in displaying the status of the directory the user is working on. It displays any changes that have been made to files since the last commit, including any alterations, additions, or deletions. Git status returns information about the branch you're on, untracked files, changes that need to be committed, and changes that aren't ready for commit.


git log - This command shows a list of commits in the repository in chronological order, beginning with the most recent commit and moving backward in time.

Example:

This picture show the output of git log and git status commands. Log commands show the commint history and the status command displaying directory info.
